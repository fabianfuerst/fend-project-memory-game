## SettingUp

To setup the project just clone it from https://github.com/fabianfuerst/fend-project-memory-game.
In the project are three main files:
1) index.html - Main and only HTML File
2) app.css - Main and only CSS File
3) app.js - Main and only JavaScript File

All the main functionality comes from the app.js file. To work on the project just open the index.html on your browser and then work on the code.


## Contributing

As this is a personal project I will not allow any push requests.
